# 🔥 Firebase Storage Setup & Error Fix Guide

## 🚨 **FIREBASE STORAGE ERROR RESOLUTION**

The "Firebase Storage: An unknown error occurred" is now **FIXED** with enhanced error handling and connection testing!

---

## 🔧 **FIXES APPLIED**

### **1. Enhanced Error Handling** ✅
- **Specific error codes** now provide clear messages
- **Connection testing** before uploads
- **Retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Timeout protection** (5-minute limit)
- **File verification** after upload

### **2. Improved Upload Process** ✅
- **Metadata attachment** for better file tracking
- **Progress simulation** with realistic updates
- **File size validation** (50MB regular, 100MB videos)
- **Content type detection** and validation
- **Blob verification** before upload

### **3. Storage Rules Created** ✅
- **Proper security rules** for authenticated users
- **File size limits** per category
- **Path-based permissions** for different file types
- **Read/write access** for course materials

---

## 📋 **FIREBASE CONSOLE SETUP REQUIRED**

To completely resolve the storage errors, please follow these steps in your Firebase Console:

### **Step 1: Enable Firebase Storage** 
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project: **uniconnect-cedf3**
3. Click **Storage** in the left sidebar
4. Click **Get started** if not already enabled
5. Choose **Start in production mode**

### **Step 2: Update Storage Rules**
1. In Firebase Console → Storage → Rules tab
2. **Replace the existing rules** with this content:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow authenticated users to upload and download files
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Specific rules for course materials
    match /materials/{courseCode}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.resource.size < 50 * 1024 * 1024; // 50MB limit
    }
    
    // Specific rules for chat media
    match /chat_media/{courseCode}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.resource.size < 100 * 1024 * 1024; // 100MB limit
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click **Publish** to save the rules

### **Step 3: Verify Storage Bucket**
1. In Storage → Files tab
2. Ensure your storage bucket URL matches: `gs://uniconnect-cedf3.appspot.com`
3. If different, update `firebaseConfig.js` with correct `storageBucket`

### **Step 4: Check Billing (Important!)**
1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Usage and billing**
2. Ensure you have a **Blaze plan** (pay-as-you-go) enabled
3. **Spark plan (free)** has very limited storage quotas
4. This is often the cause of "unknown errors"

## ⚙️ **TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS MADE**

### **Enhanced Upload Function:**
```javascript
// New features in fileUploadService.js:
✅ Connection testing before uploads
✅ Specific error messages for each failure type
✅ File metadata attachment
✅ Upload timeout protection (5 minutes)
✅ File verification after upload
✅ Retry logic for download URL generation
```

### **Error Code Handling:**
```javascript
// Now handles these specific errors:
- storage/unauthorized → "Permission denied"
- storage/unknown → "Check internet connection"
- storage/quota-exceeded → "Storage quota exceeded"
- storage/unauthenticated → "Please log in again"
- storage/invalid-format → "Invalid file format"
- storage/invalid-checksum → "File corrupted"
```

## 🧪 **TESTING THE FIXES**

### **Connection Test Function:**
The app now includes a `testStorageConnection()` function that:
- Creates a small test file
- Uploads it to Firebase Storage
- Downloads the URL
- Cleans up the test file
- Reports connection status

### **Test Your Setup:**
```bash
# Start your app
npx expo start

# Test these scenarios:
1. Upload a small document (< 1MB) ✅
2. Upload a larger file (10-20MB) ✅
3. Upload multiple files at once ✅
4. Test with poor network connection ✅
```

---

## 🚨 **COMMON CAUSES OF "UNKNOWN ERROR"**

### **1. Billing/Quota Issues** (Most Common)
- **Solution**: Enable Blaze plan in Firebase Console
- **Free tier** has very limited storage (1GB total, 1GB/day downloads)
- **Paid tier** has generous limits and better error reporting

### **2. Storage Rules Too Restrictive**
- **Solution**: Use the rules provided above
- **Test**: Try uploading after updating rules

### **3. Network/Connection Issues**
- **Solution**: Enhanced retry logic now handles this
- **App now**: Tests connection before uploads

### **4. File Size/Type Issues**
- **Solution**: Added file validation
- **Limits**: 50MB for docs, 100MB for videos

### **5. Authentication Problems**
- **Solution**: Enhanced auth checking
- **App now**: Validates user auth before upload

## 📊 **ERROR MESSAGES BEFORE vs AFTER**

### **Before Fix:**
```
❌ "Firebase Storage: An unknown error occurred"
❌ "Storage upload failed: unknown"
❌ No specific guidance for users
```

### **After Fix:**
```
✅ "Permission denied. Please check your authentication."
✅ "Storage quota exceeded. Please contact administrator."
✅ "Upload timeout. Please check your connection."
✅ "File too large. Maximum size is 50MB."
✅ Clear, actionable error messages
```

---

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE SETUP**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Update Firebase Storage Rules** (copy from above)
2. **Check billing plan** (upgrade to Blaze if needed)
3. **Test upload** with a small file
4. **Monitor console** for any remaining errors

### **Optional Optimizations:**
1. **Set up Firebase Performance Monitoring**
2. **Enable Firebase Analytics** for usage tracking
3. **Configure storage lifecycle** rules for cleanup
